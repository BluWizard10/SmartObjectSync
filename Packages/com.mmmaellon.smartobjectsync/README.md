## Ask questions on my Discord Server: <https://discord.gg/S5sDC4PnFp>

A drop-in replacement for VRC_ObjectSync that allows for better syncing of objects in VRChat

Just add SmartObjectSync to your object and hit the setup button if you see one. Setup button only appears if the auto-setup fails or if you change other components that would affect how SmartObjectSync works.

## Install

Navigate to <https://github.com/MMMaellon/SmartObjectSync/releases> and download the latest .unitypackage
Double-click the .unitypackage with your Unity Project open to import it.

This will install the minimal scripts needed.
If you want to also download the example projects, download the git repo or go to Window > Package Manager and install with this git URL: <https://github.com/MMMaellon/SmartObjectSync.git>

## Examples

You have to download the entire git repo if you want to access the example projects. Make sure you're using the git URL or you're cloning the entire repo from <https://github.com/MMMaellon/SmartObjectSync>

Then open the Example Scenes by following these steps:

1) Window > Package Manager
2) Set the drop-down in the top left to "In Project" and select SmartObjectSync under the "custom" category
3) Import one of the example scenes
